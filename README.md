MemoryGame

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------
Simple game of concentration where player 1 and 2 go up
against each other and see who can match all of the gifs
with the least amount of clicks. Whoever gets all of the
6 matches with the least number of clicks is the winner.

Gameplay
---------------------------------------------------------------
The board shuffles/resets after each person's turn and also when
"play again" is clicked. Pretty much a race against how many clicks 
are used in order to beat the other player. If two cards match
then they stay face up on the screen. If two cards don't match
then they go back to hidden. The winner of the game is announced on
the left side of the board based on the amount of clicks.
